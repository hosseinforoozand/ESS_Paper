# Instruction to reproduce results from Paper:

1) Get rawdata_time_series.csv or Download monthly precipitation data for the 1950–2007 from Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS) (PICS website: https://www.pacificclimate.org/data/prism-climatology-and-monthly-timeseries-portal). rawdata_geographical_information.csv file contains geographical information of 32 chosen grid centers for location of candidate rain gauge stations. 


2) Run 'Notebook_results_maxJEUI_method.ipynb' script to reproduce Figures 3,4,7 and all Tables presented in the paper. Note that 'maxJEUI_function_list.py' file must be saved in the same directory. This notebook generates two '.csv' files that serve as inputs to produce figure 6 and 8 in R scripts.
